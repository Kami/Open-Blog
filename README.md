# Open-Blog

Open Blog is a free and open source blogging platform built using
the CodeIgniter PHP framework.
It provides users with a very powerful yet easy to use interface
which makes blogging simple and enjoyable.

## Deprecation Notice

Development of this project has been stopped in 2010. Code is outdated and
might contain security vulnerabilities so you are **strongly advised against
using it**.

Back when the development has been stopped, domain and other project related
properties have been transfered to an Open Blog user who wanted to take over
the project and continue working on it. Sadly this user never continued with
the development so the project was left to die.
